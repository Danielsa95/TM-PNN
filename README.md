# TM-PNN
PACS PROJECT 2020/2021
The code is organized in more folders where in each of them there are examples that use the .py file named "weights" and "helper_fun" that are in the main "Code" folder.
A .txt file called "Requirements" lists the modules necessary to run the examples. 
In Code/TM-Examples there are four folders that contains the relative example and a .dat file that is given from the output of RKSolver/main_rk45.cpp of the course, used to 
test the efficency of the solution of the TM method.
In Code/TM-PNN there are two .py file that are the Lotka_Volterra resolution example using PNN and a file called "NN_structure" where there are the implementation of the personalized neurons/layer.
